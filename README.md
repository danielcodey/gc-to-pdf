### A simple GCash transaction history PDF to CSV converter

### Why?
The transaction history PDF gcash is sending might be useful to see the total and all your spendings but the usefulness subsides if you want to visualize, sort or make a graph of your total spending for a particular time frame

So I made this simple repo to convert the PDF into CSV and allow us to do cool things with this data.

### Usage
1. (suggested) - Create a venv
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. paste the PDF in the root folder and rename with 'pdf.pdf' (or you can modify the path in the converter.py)
4. on the converter.py file, replace the password with your password.
5. Run the script: `python3 converter.py`
